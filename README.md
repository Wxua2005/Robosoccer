# IIT-Madras Robosoccer
This repository contains the code we used for our bots.
We competed in the 2-bot category, our bots were controlled via Bluetooth through playstation controllers.

## Bot constraints
**Length** (vertical & horizontal) : 300 mm\
**Weight** (excluding controllers) : 5 Kg

## Libraries
We used the Bluepad32 library to facilitate communication between the controllers and the ESP32 and translate the joy values into PWM.  

## Electrical Design
| Component  | Quantity |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ESP32 Microcontroller      | 2x     |
| Rhino MDD 20Amp 6V-30V Dual DC Motor Driver      | 2x     |
| Lithium ion battery      | 2x     |
| LM2596S DC-DC Buck Converter | 2x |

## Overall Experience
We had a really fun time building our bots, working till 2am almost every day to get the mechanical design right\
About the actual competition itself.... *****ahem***** <br>

the organisation and management was pretty terrible and were clueless for the whole time, the rulebook mentioned the constraints for the convex hull on the bots would not enclose more than 70% of the bots and that everybot must have a killswitch on it but we got people bringing in bots which followed none of these rules and the organisers doing almost nothing to stop this (Look at our Round 1 match in the clips section). Also there was no rule against ball hogging (sitting with it in your own side and preventing the opponent from gaining possession)
